# FriendFinder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

* Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Instructions

1. Your survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

I was fascinated by the questions on the demo survey and what they measure. People are into shallow measures of compatibility (nothing new) and I wanted to shake this one up by translating the original statements into language that better defines the sought after match characteristics. It's seemingly sarcastic, but only will be to those who've never bothered to ask themselves questions about their own psychology. I think it's more fun than the example.
